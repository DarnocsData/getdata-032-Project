# Course Project for the John Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data paper

The aim of this project was to create a tidy dataset from data collected from the accelerometers in the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. These data were collected from 30 different subjects and assigned to one of six different activities: 1 WALKING, 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 4 SITTING, 5 STANDING, 6 LAYING.

An R script called run_analysis.R was created that does the following. 
*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
*From the data set creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

This repository contains:
1. The resultant tidy dataset tidydata.txt
2. the R code run_analysis.R  used to create the tidy dataset above.
3. a code book CodeBook.md  describing the variables, the data, and the  transformations performed to clean up the data
4. this Readme.md document
